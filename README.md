# Getting Started

### How Run the Project?:
1. Clone the repository and open the project
2. go the terminal and run the following commands:
    (Make sure you have the environment file first)
     npm install
     npm node app.js
3. Go to the terminal of the client side by the command cd client-side and run following commands:

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, Material-UI (MUI) for design
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)

## Improvements I Would Make If I Had More Time
1. **Store token in cookies** instead of local storage for better security.
2. **Enhance user experience** by improving the design and adding validation.
3. **Implement additional features** such as search functionality.
4. **Better JWT handling** including proper logout implementation.

## Final Thoughts
I really enjoyed working on this project and would love to receive feedback!
